# Talking2Tom
Remember *My Talking Tom* from 2010? Yeah. **He remembers you too.**

Heâ€™s angry. Heâ€™s self-aware. He wants revenge.  
And you're the one who has to talk your way out of it.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kavoyaa/talking2tom.git

```

### Set up API key
